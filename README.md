# Product preview card component

The sole purpose of this project was to create a simple design with a product cart to train responsiveness (Flexbox) in CSS3. It is possible to visualize how the project turned out in folder "design", where there is the original prototype of the challenge carried out by Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges).
